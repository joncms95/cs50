Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Predictions with number of simulations under 100 seems to be inaccurate as they give very different answers each time I run the program.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1000 simulations should be good enough as it uses the shortest compute time with an accurate prediction.
