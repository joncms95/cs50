If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

<<ANSWER>>
Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year,
Their average numbers will be as follows:
AVG ENERGY      : 0.65906
AVG VALENCE     : 0.484443
AVG DANCEABILITY: 0.71646
Based on the above data, we can deduce that the audio aura of the listener is somewhat
lively, energentic, and passionate
as the energy and danceability levels are pretty high.


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

<ANSWER>>
The calculation I made for this aura might not be very representative of the listeners as there are other different factors that determines the audio aura of a person.
In some cases, a person may only listen to a few songs repeatedly throughout the year. Perhaps when we are extracting data from the top 100 songs of the listener, we may need to consider the
frequency a song has been played by the person as well.
If a song has been played more time, the weightage of the data derived from that song itself should be much higher,
as compared to a song that has been only played a few time in the year.
